# Testing API-Based Notification Content

## Changes Implemented

1. Now using the full server response for both notifications and popup data
2. Extracting content type, file names, and other metadata from server response
3. Using server-side content when available, with fallback to original content
4. Properly handling file items with "📁 [filename]" format
5. Updated popup.js to handle the complete server response object

## Test Cases

### 1. Text Content Transmission
- Select and send text content
- Verify notification uses server response data
- Check that popup shows the same server data

### 2. File Content (if server supports it)
- If sending file-like content
- Verify notification shows "📁 [filename]" format when available

### 3. Content Type Detection 
- Verify correct icon is shown based on server-reported content type
- TEXT → 📝
- IMAGE → 🖼️
- FILE → 📎

### 4. Server Response Handling
- Verify all fields from server response are properly stored
- Check that share token and URL are correctly extracted from response.share

### 5. Fallback Behavior
- If server response doesn't have certain fields, verify fallbacks work properly
- If content is not in response, verify original content is used as backup
